# N Queens Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This repo illustrates the concept of Genetic Computing based approach for the famous N-Queens Problem.

The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. Ref : Genetic Computing

The objective is to be able to find an arrangement of N queens on a chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.The chess queens can attack in any direction as horizontal, vertical, horizontal and diagonal way.A binary matrix is used to display the positions of N Queens, where no queens can attack other queens.

In the context of Genetic Computing the following are the key elements:
- Defining a solution space by generating an initial population
- The solution space consists of potential configurations
- Defining a fitness function to evaluate the solutions in the solution space
- Once the initial population and fitness score is done, new configurations are created in the solution space through crossover and mutation.
